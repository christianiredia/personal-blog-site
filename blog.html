              Who am I you ask?
              <br />
              My name is Christian Iredia. I am an extremly hardworking person
              with alot of goals that I will meet.
            </p>
            <p>Welcome to my site. Welcome to my life.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I am the next great Software Developer.
              <br />
              Ever since I was a kid I was always known as the "hardest worker
              in the room", and I carry that same mindset even now.
              <br>
              <p>
                Though I love Software Development I still have other things that
              I love to do when I am not reading or coding.
              </p>

            <hr />
            <p>
            
              I love sports!
              <br />
              I am always up for a nice outing to a game, or even something as
              simple as watching the games with friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am a multiple time Fantasy Football champion! Humbly I must say,
              I am really great at the game!
              <br />
              If you ever need some Fantasy Football tips, I'm Your Guy!
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Other things that I enjoy doing with my free time can range from
              things like, working out, exercising, playing video games with
              friends, listening to music, dancing and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are some of the things that keep me grounded and fulfilled
              when I am not coding.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ultimately, software development comes first, it has developed into a huge passion of mine(pun intended).
