              Who am I you ask? My name is Christian Iredia, and I was born in
              Houston Texas, where I still currently reside. I am an extremly
              hardworking person with alot of goals for what I want to do, and
              where I want to be in life.

            <p>Welcome to my site. Welcome to my life.</p>

              I want to be and great Software Developer, and I know I will be
              one because my study habits and work ethic is bar none. Ever since
              I was a kid I was always known as the "hardest worker in the
              room", and I carry that same mindset even now as a grown man.

              Though I love Software Development I still have other things that
              I love to do when I am not reading or coding. One, I love sports!
              I am a big NFL and NBA fan! So I am always up for a nice outing to
              a game, or even something as simple as watching the games with
              friends
            </p>

            <p>
              I am a multiple time Fantasy Football champion! I am really great
              at the game, in the most humble way I can say it! If you ever need
              some Fantasy Football tips, I'm Your Guy!
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Other things that I enjoy doing with my free time can range from
              things like, working out, exercising, playing video games with
              friends, listening to music, dancing and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are some of the things that keep me grounded and fulfilled
              when I am not coding.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But Ultimately, software development comes first, as it has no pun
              intended, developed, into a huge passion of mine.
