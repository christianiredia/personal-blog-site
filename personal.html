            <p>
              Growing up I was always very much into tech, something about it
              always gravitated me towards it. I did not know anything about
              development, I had a friend that mentioned it to me and showed me
              some code that he had created, and Instantly fell in love!

              love the winter time! Love being able to bring the jacket out and
              the long sleeve shirts! Living in Houston, it is ALWAYS hot! I
              rarely get to enjoy the simple pleasures of snow, Makes you
              cherish the colder days even more.

              team aspects. Growing up I wanted to play sports, I was very fast,
              football was the first sport that caught my eye, so it has always
              been a love of mine since.

              Hard not to love this dog, the Golden Retriever. Such a beauty to
              look at, and there are sweet dogs too! Growing up my favorite
              movie was "Buddy!". So If you know a thing or two about that
              movie, you can easily see why it's my favorite dog!

              Remember my favorite sport? If so this should be an easy one...
              Madden! My favorite video game, I have been playing madden since I
              was a litle kid. Year after Year, through the ups and downs of
              winning and losing, Madden will always be my favorite game ever.
